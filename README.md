# Landing Page Project
A landing page implemented using CSS and HTML and using the Flexbox layout. This project built from scratch using [design specifications](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page#assignment) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an Open Source Curriculum which teaches Full Stack Development.

Here are the Design Specifications images (Project encourages creative liberty, and not a 1 to 1 copy):
